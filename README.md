# Even-Simpler
The Dead Simple Sprite Mod - downported to Vanilla.  The goal of this project is to provide a more **_visually appealing_** (notice: not necessarily "smoother") experience while playing Doom, Doom II, and its plethora of mods.  Additionally this mod is designed to fulfill the goal I'd originally set out to meet when creating The Dead Simple Sprite Mod (since I kinda lost the plot with that one) by maximizing compatibility for both source ports and map wads.  This is accomplished by manipulating states at an individual level and using as little DeHackEd as possible.

HOW TO USE:
If your source port has an autoload folder and you want to use them, you can go ahead and add the NUGHUD into the "all" section and just skip anything related to it in the instructions below.
Load order matters here, though in most instances it's no different than you're used to. If you're NOT playing Legacy of Rust, load the IWAD, then map PWAD, then the weapons mod of your choosing, then the NUGHUD if you so-desire. If you ARE playing Legacy of Rust, the weapons mod must be loaded BEFORE Legacy of Rust to allow overwriting the Plasma Rifle and BFG. The Rust Patch must be loaded afterwards to put the new shocktrooper sprites and strings consistent with the LoR content in the game. Regardless the gameplay mod you're using, load DeadSimpleExtra.wad afterwards. NUGHUD goes at the end as per usual.

**VERSION 2.0 IS NOW RELEASED!**

A lot has changed under the hood from the previous releases, though you may not notice immediately when playing.  Two big changes to address first and foremost:
1. A new file, EvenSimplerGloves.wad, is now included.  This version of the mod has been resprited to use Tesefy's box art gloves on the weapons.  More importantly though:
2. **EVEN SIMPLER HAS BEEN DOWNPORTED FROM BOOM/COMPLVL 9 TO VANILLA/COMPLVL 2.** This should mean more compatibility with more things and, theoretically, compatibility with Chocolate Doom.  I have no idea how to get Chocolate working though, so that part is left as an exercise for the reader.  Make sure you let me know how you did it though, if you do.  See the changelog in the release for full details.
